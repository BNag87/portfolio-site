        <P>
            I've always been interested in technology. By the time I was in college, I became the tech support for my family.<br/>
            Most people would cite that as being a headache, but I enjoyed it. Helping people with technical issues was rewarding and pushed me to develop an interest in coding.<br/>
            I like being certain of what I'm practicing, so I explore multiple possibilities to find the most effective solution for the task.<br/>

        <P>
            More stuff
        </P>

        <P>
            Inconceivably, more stuff!
