<H3>Welcome!</H3>
<P>I'm Basil and I want to work as an apprentice/junior programmer.</P>
<P>I've always been interested in writing code and am putting all of my effort in to making it a career.</P>
<P>I have completed a course with Codenation, titled "<i>Level 2 Certificate in IT User Skills (Open Systems and Enterprise) (ITQ)</i>", which taught me how to use Python, HTML and CSS.
<br/>After this, I then took and completed a coding mastery course. Over three months, I learned how to use React to build apps and enjoy this a great deal more.
<br/>I have taught myself several languages over the years and don't want it to just be a hobby.</P>
<P>I prefer front-end work, though I am open to full stack as well.</P>

<P>On the About Me page, there are some examples of projects I've done in the past, with screenshots.
<br/>On the Projects/Code page, I have snippets of code that have proven useful. There are also links to repositories I've made in my own time.</P>

<P>If you'd like to speak to me about possible employment, then head to the About Me page.</P>

<H3>Thanks for visiting!</H3>
